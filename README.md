# Personality Types Website

This is a multi-page interactive website created as a final group project for **CS 103: Web Design and the World Wide Web** at Boston University. Our site introduces the 16 MBTI personality types, explores compatibility between them, and showcases examples from popular culture.

## My Contributions

I (Bunjiro) contributed heavily to the following pages and components:

### `home.html` + `home.css`
- Designed and built the landing page layout and style.
- Created a visually interactive homepage with hover effects on the navigation tiles.
- Ensured responsiveness for smaller screen sizes using media queries.

### `compatibility.html` + `compatibility.css`
- Developed an interactive MBTI compatibility matrix with color-coded levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low).
- Styled and structured the table to enhance readability and user interaction.
- Integrated ScrollReveal.js animations for a dynamic, scroll-based reveal of compatibility explanations and images.

### `credits.html` + `credits.css`
- Compiled and formatted citation info for all resources used, including images and scripts.
- Built the credits navigation bar and responsive layout.
